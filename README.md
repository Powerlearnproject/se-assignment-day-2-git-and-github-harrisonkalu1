## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Fundermental concepts of version control: Version control is a system that helps manage changes to code, documents, or other digital content overtime.it allows mutiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking changes, and identifying who made those changes, and enabling the recovery of previous versions if needed.
Key components of version control: Repository, Commits, Branches, Merging.
Repository: A central location where all the files, history, and metadata of a project are stored.
Commits: Snapshots of changes made to the code, along with a description of the changes and the author.
Branches: Separate lines of development in a repository, allowing multiple versions of the code to coexist.
Merging: This the process of integrating changes from one branche into another.
Why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code: Cloud based repository, Version control system, Collaboration features and Large community.
How version control help in maintaining project integrity: Change tracking, Revert changes, Collaboration, Code review, Backup and recovery.
1. Change tracking: Version control system like Git track changes made to the code, it makes developers to know who made changes and when.
2. Revert changes: If a change introduces a bug or breaks the code, version control makes developers to go back to previous version.
3. Collaboration: vVersion control enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project without conflicts .
